//! Dependency management subsystem.
//!
//! Manages forked crate dependencies across a Cosmos monorepo with multiple
//! Rust workspace roots. Provides switching between local/git/stable modes,
//! dependency scanning, topological ordering, and dashboards.
//!
//! Source of truth is the `dependency-matrix.toml` file in `_devops/`.
